# Contentful organisation

There are a number of content models in contentful the intro comittee can control:

- **Hero**: This is header of the page. The content text area is the text that is displayed on top of the carousel. The images themselves can be selected in the pictures area beneath the text area. The title of each picture is used to display the "Foto: " text at the bottom right of the carousel.
- **Information**: The information model is the section immediately under the hero. The content section again contains all of the text. The coloured text in the headings can be done by making the desired text in the heading bold. Non-heading text in bold will not be coloured.

  The images field contains all of the images on the right-hand side. There is no minimum or maximum on the number of images; they will keep stacking under each other.
- **Signup**: This section is the coloured banner. Again the content field is straightforward. The button link and button content fields are for the button underneath the text.
- **Theme**: The theme section consists of three subsections:
    - content contains the permanent content about the theming.
    - reveal contains the revealed theme. It is allowed to include at most one image that will be displayed in full width in a seperate box.
    - supermentors is a text box that can contain links to supermentor models. The supermentor models are displayed inline, where the text is displayed on the left and the image is displayed on the right. The images are not removed on smaller screens.
- **Association**: The association section only contains a content field. The sticky logo on the right is automatically retrieved from svsticky.nl's branding page.
- **FAQ** and **Small print**: Again, a simple section with just a content text area.
- **Contact**: The contact content and contact persons are displayed first. The contact content is the text above the cards displaying the contact people. For the confidential advisors the same applies.

To edit a model, log into contentful and press content in the nav bar. Then in the bar of the left, select the content model you wish to edit. All of the content models have just one instance, except for the person model. The titles of the instances cannot be set, so it is advised to just filter by content type.
